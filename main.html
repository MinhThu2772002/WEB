                                       <h5>There are several causes that contribute to the invasion of privacy throughout social networking platforms.</h5>

                                          It has been recognized that “by design, social media technologies contest mechanisms for control and access to personal information, as the sharing of user-generated content is central to their function." This proves that social networking companies need private information to become public so their sites can operate.
                                          <br><br>
                                          Once something is posted on the internet, it becomes public and is no longer private. Users can turn privacy settings on for their accounts; however, that does not guarantee that information will not go beyond their intended audience. Pictures and posts can be saved and posts may never really get deleted.

                                          “According to research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group, privacy of personal data is a top issue for 76 percent of global consumers and 83 percent of U.S. consumers.” Six-in-ten Americans (61%) have said they would like to do more to protect their privacy.

                                          Privacy should be a main concern, especially for teens who may not be entirely informed about the importance and consequences of public versus private use.
